## Procedure

1. Check if buttons have hover styles by long tapping on them and releasing the finger.

	### Expected result

	* On Android: there are hover styles **during** the tap (e.g. background becomes darker).
	* On iOS: hover styles can be absent during the tap.
	* There aren't any hover styles **after** releasing the finger.

	### Unexpected result

	* On Android: there aren't any hover styles **during** the tap.
	* There are hover style (e.g. background became darker) **after** releasing the finger.

	### Notes:

	* Moono Lisa does not provide hover styles for on buttons.
	* On iOS long tap can also focus the editor.

2. Check if taping on buttons activate their active state.

	### Expected result

	* Tapped button has active state (e.g background became lighter or the button seems "pressed").

	### Unexpected result

	* Tapped button does not have active state.
3. Repeat the procedure for the second editor.
4. Repeat the procedure for rich combos.
